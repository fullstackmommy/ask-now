# AskNow

Sometimes things need to be asked, and you donâ€™t want to be the one to say them out loud. Or simply, you may not remember that burning question anymore by the time the Q&A session begins.

This react app aims to make it simple for audience, especially the quiet type, to ask questions any time during a presentation. As questions appear onscreen, the audience may upvote the one they like. Other than as a feedback on general questions from the audience, this ranking feature gives insights to the speaker/moderator about which (most burning) questions they should spend time discussing during the Q&A session.

Another potential use is for collecting questions and identify popular questions prior to the event. This enables the speaker to tailor the content or structure of his/her upcoming presentation based on what the audience wants/needs.

Basic features included in this version:

1. Allow audience to post questions anonymously
2. The best questions rise to the top of the list, and the rest fall to the bottom.
3. Allow admin/moderator to create and delete an event code
4. Gamification:

Potential features to be added:

1. Allow admin/moderator to delete any obnoxious question
2. Allow search questions by keywords
3. Real-time Polling
